2. IMSI (E.212) to MGT (E.214) Translation
IMSI (E.212) should be translated to MGT (E.214) as follows:
MCC(440) MNC(50) MSIN (10 digits) -> CC(81) NDC(80931) MSIN (most significant 8 digits only)
MCC(440) MNC(51) MSIN (10 digits) -> CC(81) NDC(80984) MSIN (most significant 8 digits only)
MCC(440) MNC(54) MSIN (10 digits) -> CC(81) NDC(80984) MSIN (most significant 8 digits only)
"Please be noted that newly added MCC-MNC:440-54 uses a common MGT prefix:81 80984 which is being used for MCC-MNC:440-51 as shown
above."
"In accordance with ITU-T E.214, please make sure that your MSC/VLR truncates the least significant two (2) digis of MSIN when it translate IMSI to
MGT."
<Translation Example>
440 50 12345 67890 -> 81 80931 12345 678
440 51 12345 67890 -> 81 80984 12345 678
440 54 12345 67890 -> 81 80984 12345 678
